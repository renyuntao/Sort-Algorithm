# Description
Two ways to implement quicksort.    
Run program as   
`$ g++ -std=gnu++11 quicksort.cxx && ./a.out`     
or    
`$ g++ -std=gnu++11 quicksort2.cxx && ./a.out`      
# Sort data that have many duplication element
`quicksort3.cxx` is a quick sort algorithm variation that for the data set have many duplicate element or the data set is mostly sorted.    
You can run this program as     
`$ g++ -std=gnu++11 quicksort3.cxx && ./a.out`
